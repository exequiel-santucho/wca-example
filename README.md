# Example of Worst Case Analysis (WCA) in a simple electronic circuit

The objective in this notebook is to apply three methodologies to determine the minimun and maximun value of output voltage. The proposed methodologies are:

- **Theoretical Result**: after the analysis of the circuit by the expert, the theoretically expected values are established.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: the problem is resolved using a stochastic approach, simulating the variation of the output variable underassumption of certain probability distribution for the dependent ones.

- **Mathematical programming**: the problem is formulated as a constrained minimization/maximization problem, which is tackled applyying KKT conditions or the clasical Simplex Method.

#### Conclusion

It can be seen that the three methodologies proposed for the resolution of WCA problem are equivalent.
